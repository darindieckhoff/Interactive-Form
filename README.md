In this project, you'll create an interactive registration form for "FullStack Conf". Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll use JavaScript to enhance the form by adding interactivity. You can use plain JavaScript or jQuery –– it's up to you!

This project is a great way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives you a simple interactive portfolio project you can use to show off your understanding of JavaScript. Forms are a large part of any web application, so learning how to make them easy-to-use, interactive and responsive is a task you should master.
